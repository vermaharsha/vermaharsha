I believe technology should **simplify life**, not complicate it —  
that’s why I focus on building **clean, meaningful, and user-centered digital experiences** for people and businesses.

## 💡 My Approach

- I build with **clarity, creativity, and performance** in mind  
- I care deeply about **user experience and long-term maintainability**  
- I prefer **simple, thoughtful solutions** over overengineering  
- I enjoy turning vague ideas into **clear, working products**

Hey! I’m Harsha 👋  
I design and develop websites that are **easy to use, easy to manage, and built to grow**.

I enjoy working with:

When a project needs it, I collaborate with trusted designers or developers — while keeping communication and ownership clear.
